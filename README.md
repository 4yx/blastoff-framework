# Welcome to Blastoff.

Welcome to our guide site for Blastoff. This is where you can get help, read tutorials or learn more about the framework, and how you can run your own super customized bot.  
  
As a public framework, you can request to edit this wiki system, to add more. Just submit a pull request with what you have added - then we can look over it!

Blastoff functions like a 'reseller'. We provide the framework, and you customize the bot to gain more users. 

Blastoff is open source, which makes it simple to edit and change stuff. If you plan on doing that - checkout the[ Open-Source page](setup/open-source-license.md).
