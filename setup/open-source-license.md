Blastoff is licensed as open source. Specifically, under the GNU Public License \(v3\). You can read the license by clicking [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

When you use Blastoff for your Discord bot - we ask that you leave the framework version alone. Failure to do this can lead to questioning, as developers rights, and all developers should be credited.

If you have added onto the bot, using **your own code.** Which isn't stolen from a site, and has been written out - you can do the following to the framework information:  
›› Change the name to a double barrel \(eg. EpicBot-Blastoff Framework\)  
›› Change the framework number to your own, leaving Blastoff's branding.  
  
**Failure to follow our guidelines will just make you a human scum for not reserving rights to the original creator/s.**

Developers who write software can release it under the terms of the GNU GPL. When they do, it will be free software and stay free software, no matter who changes or distributes the program. We call this copyleft: the software is copyrighted, but instead of using those rights to restrict users like proprietary software does, we use them to ensure that every user has freedom.

We update the GPL to protect its copyleft from being undermined by legal or technological developments. The most recent version protects users from three recent threats:

* Tivoization: Some companies have created various different kinds of devices that run GPLed software, and then rigged the hardware so that they can change the software that's running, but you cannot. If a device can run arbitrary software, it's a general-purpose computer, and its owner should control what it does. When a device thwarts you from doing that, we call that tivoization.
* Laws prohibiting free software: Legislation like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European Union Copyright Directive make it a crime to write or share software that can break DRM \(Digital Restrictions Management; see [below](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html#neutralizing-laws-that-prohibit-free-software-but-not-forbidding-drm)\). These laws should not interfere with the rights the GPL grants you.
* Discriminatory patent deals: Microsoft has recently started telling people that they will not sue free software users for patent infringement—as long as you get the software from a vendor that's paying Microsoft for the privilege. Ultimately, Microsoft is trying to collect royalties for the use of free software, which interferes with users' freedom. No company should be able to do this.

Version 3 also has a number of improvements to make the license easier for everyone to use and understand. But even with all these changes, GPLv3 isn't a radical new license; instead it's an evolution of the previous version. Though a lot of text has changed, much of it simply clarifies what GPLv2 said. With that in mind, let's review the major changes in GPLv3, and talk about how they improve the license for users and developers.
