# Blastoff Discord Bot
A modular &amp; easy-to-use Discord bot framework.

### We ask that you read below, and to avoid getting questioned for not leaving the correct credits.

Blastoff is an easy to setup bot. It can be used with Glitch, and will be simpler to setup on there. Blastoff includes many commands, all situated in a command handler, which makes it easier to include more commands, by just adding your code into a file.

## Open Source License
Blastoff is built from scratch, meaning hard work. We ask that you leave the framework settings in the config file, which leaves us credit for the work we did. If we find that you have not left credit, you will be questioned on that course. To not leave credit, you need to edit the bot to a satifactory amount so it does not resemble the original source code. We ask that you respect and follow this statement.

## Setup Guide
1) Go onto the Glitch website and create an account.
2) When you return to the homepage, you should see a '+' symbol yn the corner.
3) Click on the '+' and then choose 'Import from GitHub'.
4) When prompted to choose a repository, enter "GIT URL"
5) When the file is loaded, head over to the 'config.json' file.
6) Within the 'config.json' file, add the following information:
 - Bot Token
 - Bot Name
 - Bot Icon URL
 - Bot Client ID
 - Bot Prefix
 - Owner (you)'s ID
 - Logging channel ID (Hub Server)
 
 Do NOT edit the Framework Name or FWVER, unless you have changed the bot so it isnt recognizable as Blastoff.
