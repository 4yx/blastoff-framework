# Welcome to Blastoff.

Welcome to our guide site for Blastoff. This is where you can get help, read tutorials or learn more about the framework, and how you can run your own super customized bot.

Blastoff functions like a 'reseller'. We provide the framework, and you customize the bot to gain more users. 

Blastoff is open source, which makes it simple to edit and change stuff. If you plan on doing that - checkout the[ Open-Source page](setup/open-source-license.md).
